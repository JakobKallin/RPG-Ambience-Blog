	<h1>Partial audio support on mobile browsers</h1>

				<p>Due to a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=178297">significant browser restriction</a>, RPG Ambience has so far been unable to play audio on mobile browsers. I just updated <a href="http://app.rpg-ambience.com/">the app</a>, however, with a small fix that adds partial support for audio on mobile browsers. While basic playback works as intended, note that <em>this support is purely experimental</em> and there is a severe limitation: <em>only the first track in any given scene will play, and looping is not supported</em>.</p>
				
				<p>For <a href="/articles/next-version/">the next version of RPG Ambience</a>, I plan to remove this limitation. (I have a solution in mind, but itâ€™s not as simple to implement as this experimental support.) I also intend to optimize the user interface so that it looks better on mobile devices, especially phones. Finally, I also hope to implement <a href="https://github.com/JakobKallin/RPG-Ambience/issues/64">network ambience</a>, to make mobile devices useful not only as standalone players but also as players in a multi-device setup.</p>
				
				<p>For now, partial audio support is the best thing available. If you use RPG Ambience primarily as a soundboard with one-shot sound effects, it might be enough for your purposes.</p>
				
				<p>If you have comments on this experimental feature, or on aspects of RPG Ambience in general, please <a href="mailto:rpg.ambience@gmail.com">send an email</a>, post to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rpg-ambience">Google Group</a>, or comment on <a href="https://github.com/JakobKallin/RPG-Ambience/issues">GitHub</a>.</p>
