			<p>While this blog clearly encourages the use of ambience in roleplaying games, some groups might find that ambience is not for them. What follows is a list of problems that you might run into when using ambience, as well as a few suggestions for how they might be avoided.</p>

			<h2>Technology</h2>
			<ul><li>You always need to have a computer available, as well as speakers and/or a monitor.</li>
				<li>Malfunctions, depleted batteries, and power outages can cause your setup to fail.</li>
				<li>If you use visuals, you need to reserve space for a monitor around the gaming table&mdash;possibly an entire side.</li>
				<li>If you use sound, you need to play in a calm area where you can hear the sound without disturbing others.</li>
				<li>Players who cannot accommodate for any of the above points might become less eager to offer their homes as gaming areas.</li>
			</ul><h2>Possible solutions</h2>
			<ul><li>Avoid conveying crucial information through your ambience, so that you can play without it if necessary.</li>
			</ul><h2>Distractions</h2>
			<ul><li>Players might feel that sound or visuals distracts them from the game itself.</li>
				<li>Gamemasters might feel that having to control sound and visuals distracts them too much from other aspects of the game.</li>
			</ul><h2>Possible solutions</h2>
			<ul><li>Keep the volume low, so that your sound does not distract during conversations but still conveys a mood when there is less talking.</li>
				<li>Keep the number of scenes low, so that you have fewer decisions to make and fewer things to remember during play.</li>
				<li>If none of your ambience contains spoilers, ask one of your players to control it for you.</li>
			</ul><h2>Preparation</h2>
			<ul><li>Visuals and sound suitable for your game might be difficult to find, even when you have a lot of time to search for it.</li>
				<li>Learning how to use your software and creating ambience in it might take more time out of your preparation than you are willing to spend.</li>
			</ul><h2>Possible solutions</h2>
			<ul><li>Make use of <a href="/articles/artwork-driven-adventures/">artwork-driven adventure design</a> to make your search for images and sound easier.</li>
				<li>Ask your players to create ambience for you, possibly leaving empty slots where you can insert secret content.</li>
